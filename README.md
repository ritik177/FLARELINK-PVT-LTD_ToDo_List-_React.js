# Task Manager App

## 1. Application and Functionality

The **Task Manager App** is a simple and intuitive tool designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. The app allows users to:
- Add tasks with titles and manage task priorities.
- Search through tasks to find specific ones based on their title.
- Sort tasks by their priority (low, medium, high).
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
- All tasks are stored persistently using `localStorage`, ensuring they remain saved even after a page refresh.
