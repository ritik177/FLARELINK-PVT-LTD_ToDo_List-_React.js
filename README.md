# Task Manager App

## 1. Application and Functionality

The **Task Manager App** is a simple and intuitive tool designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. The app allows users to:

- Search through tasks to find specific ones based on their title.
- Sort tasks by their priority (low, medium, high).
